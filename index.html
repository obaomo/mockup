    <h1><strong>Humans vs. Machines: An AI Odyssey</strong></h1>
    <p>By <strong><em>Christopher Watkins</em></strong></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>March 10, 2016,</p><strong><em>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the
    first two matches!*** In this, the third in our series on the epic Go
    matches being played between AlphaGo (Googleâs Artificial Intelligence
    software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the
    history of Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to
    this incredible moment in time.</em></strong> <img src=

    <p>For as long as humans have built things, weâve wrestled with the
    implications of what weâve built. In many cases, these philosophical and
    ethical wrestlings have made for great dramaâthink Frankenstein, or 2001:
    A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision come
    remarkably close to true, and the discoveries weâve made in the fields of
    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a âcomputer
    with a mind of its ownâ is <s>going to take over the world</s> not such a
    fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>
    <h2><strong>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</strong></h2>
    <p><a href=

    target="_blank">Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs.
    machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which
    weâve created speaks to something very deep within our collective
    consciousness. When IBMâs Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov1,
    the event resulted in more than <u>three billion impressions</u> around the
    world, and when IBMâs later creation Watson challenged the champions on
    Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</a></p>
    <h2><strong>DeepMindâs AlphaGo</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="" target="_blank">Place right now, there is an event that,
    while not NO NAME to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far
    greater implications when it comes to the future of intelligentâ
    machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as
    AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMindâa Google Artificial
    Intelligence lab) began <u>a five-game match</u> against Lee Se-dol, one of
    the very best players in the world at the ancient game of tGo.</a></p>
    <h2>Why is this so significant?</h2>
    <p><a href="" target="_blank">Is how the DeepMind team explained it in
    their paper <u>Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree
    Search</u></a></p><em>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most
    challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its
    enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and
    moves.</em>
    <p>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who
    strive to create machines that can âthinkâ on their own, because
    success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than
    just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style.
    Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.</p><u></u>

    Champion</p>
